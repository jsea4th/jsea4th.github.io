        Hi! My name is Jamal Seaforth and I am a senior at the University of Maryland
        pursuing a double degree in Broadcast Journalism and International Relations
        with a minor in International Development and Conflict Management. I am a
        resident assitant on campus and I work for the Maryland football team where
        I am a videographer. I also serve as president for the university's Caribbean
        Students Association (CSA). My interest are in sports and development in the
        Caribbean.
